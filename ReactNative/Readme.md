# React Native Example

Testing example for sending spans from React Native to Lightstep with Lightstep JavaScript Tracer

1. Follow the [Environment setup instructions here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for macOS and iOS
2. Add your Lightstep access token to `App.js`
3. In one terminal: `npx react-native start`
4. In second terminal: `npx react-native start-ios`
5. See traces in your Lightstep project once the Simulator runs the app and you see the Welcome screen
6. The first terminal will have the tracer logs
